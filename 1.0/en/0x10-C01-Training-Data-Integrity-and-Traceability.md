# C1 Training Data Integrity & Traceability

## Control Objective

This chapter describes methods for sourcing, handling, and maintaining training data that preserve the traceability, integrity, and quality of the data's origins. The core security concern is ensuring data has not been tampered with, poisoned, or corrupted.

## C1.1 Training Data Origin & Data Security

Tracking the origins of training data and maintaining data security is critical to the security and trustworthiness of any AI system. Datasets must be sourced from verifiable origins and changes must be tracked across their full lifecycle so that tampering or unauthorized modification can be detected. Training data must be protected against tampering, corruption, and poisoning throughout its lifecycle.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **1.1.1** | **Verify that** training data includes only features, attributes, and fields required for the model's stated purpose. | 1 |
| **1.1.2** | **Verify that** the lineage of each dataset and its components, including all transformations, augmentations, and merges, is recorded and can be reconstructed. | 1 |
| **1.1.3** | **Verify that** an up-to-date inventory is kept of all training data sources, including information on the data's origins, any responsible parties, any licenses, all collection methods, any intended use constraints, and all processing histories. | 2 |
| **1.1.4** | **Verify that** datasets are watermarked so their uses can be attributed and any unauthorized uses detected. | 3 |
| **1.1.5** | **Verify that** data integrity is maintained as training data is stored and transferred. | 2 |
| **1.1.6** | **Verify that** integrity monitoring is used to guard against unauthorized modifications or corruption of training data. | 2 |
| **1.1.7** | **Verify that** all training datasets are uniquely identified with change tracking,  which will support rollback and forensic analysis. | 3 |

## C1.2 Data Labeling and Annotation Security

Labeling and annotation processes must be protected against unauthorized modification, data leakage, and compromises of data integrity. Annotation platforms should enforce access control, preserve auditability, and protect labeling artifacts and sensitive label content throughout the training pipeline.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **1.2.1** | **Verify that** labeling platforms enforce access controls to restrict who creates, modifies, or approves annotations. | 1 |
| **1.2.2** | **Verify that** all labeling activities are recorded in logs. | 1 |
| **1.2.3** | **Verify that** cryptographic integrity is applied to all labeling artifacts. | 2 |
| **1.2.4** | **Verify that** any sensitive information in labels is redacted, anonymized, or encrypted before being used in any labeling artifact. | 2 |

## C1.3 Training Data Quality and Security Assurance

Training data quality and security assurance controls play an important role in detecting corruption, locating poisoning, finding labeling errors, and discovering exploitable dataset patterns before any issues can affect any model behavior. Pipelines should combine automated validation, poisoning detection, label quality checks, and bias analysis.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **1.3.1** | **Verify that** training and fine-tuning pipelines implement poisoning detection techniques to identify potential data poisoning or unintentional corruption in training data. | 2 |
| **1.3.2** | **Verify that** automatically generated labels are subject to confidence thresholds and consistency checks to detect misleading or low-confidence labels. | 2 |
| **1.3.3** | **Verify that** models used in security-relevant decisions are evaluated for bias patterns. | 2 |
| **1.3.4** | **Verify that** disallowed content is detected and removed before training. | 2 |
| **1.3.5** | **Verify that** defenses against clean-label poisoning attacks are implemented. | 3 |
